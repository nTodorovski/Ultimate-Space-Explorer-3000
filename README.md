We are tasked in building a space game. In the space game we have an option to choose 3 ships with different stats and go on adventures to planets that will be shown on a galaxy map. Our job is to explore all planets in the universe. But this task will not be easy because we need to manage our ship, fuel and crew to survive this journey.
